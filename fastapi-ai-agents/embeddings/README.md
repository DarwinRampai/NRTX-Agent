# This directory contains documentation related to the embeddings used in the FastAPI AI Agents project. 

# The embeddings are crucial for implementing memory storage solutions, such as FAISS or ChromaDB, which allow the AI agents to remember past interactions and provide personalized responses.

# Future updates may include details on how to set up and use the vector databases, as well as any specific configurations or optimizations that can be applied for better performance.

# Please refer to the main project documentation for overall setup and usage instructions.
